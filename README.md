# Crytographic Coprocessor
This is a fun project to develop a simple coprocessor that implements some crytographic algorithms, Specifically some of the ones in
the proposed RISC-V crypto extenion in the NIST Suite for RV32.
It will include the following instructions:
- aes32dsi (AES final round decrypt)
- aes32dsmi (AES middle round decrypt)
- aes32esi (AES final round encrypt)
- aes32esmi (AES  middle round encrypt)
- sha256sig0 (SHA2-256 Sigma0)
- sha256sum1 (SHA2-256 Sigma1)
- sha256sig1 (SHA2-256 Sigma1)
- sha256sig1 (SHA2-256 Sigma1)
